## üß† AI Chatbot Technical Architecture

### How MetaGrow AI Works

The chatbot leverages a sophisticated RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) pipeline:

1. **Knowledge Ingestion**
   - Automatically indexes all website pages, components, and documentation
   - Chunks content into semantic segments with configurable overlap
   - Generates embeddings using Cohere's `embed-english-v3.0` model
   - Stores vectors in Pinecone for fast similarity search

2. **Query Processing**
   - User queries are embedded in real-time
   - Performs vector similarity search to retrieve top-k relevant contexts
   - Dynamically boosts specific contexts (e.g., founder info) based on query patterns
   - Handles keyword-based escalation for pricing, quotes, and custom requests

3. **Response Generation**
   - Uses Cohere's `command-a-03-2025` model for natural language generation
   - System prompt constrains responses to be concise (1-3 sentences)
   - Answers strictly from retrieved context to prevent hallucinations
   - Implements rate limiting and exponential backoff for API stability

4. **Smart Escalation**
   - Detects when answers are unavailable or user needs human support
   - Automatically collects contact information (name, email, phone)
   - Triggers email notifications to support team via `supportEmail` service
   - Maintains conversation context for seamless handoff

5. **Conversation Management**
   - Multi-step conversation flow: greeting ‚Üí analyzing ‚Üí suggestion ‚Üí budget ‚Üí lead
   - Extracts user data (business niche, website URL, social links, budget)
   - Contextual state management using React Context API
   - Persistent chat history within session
