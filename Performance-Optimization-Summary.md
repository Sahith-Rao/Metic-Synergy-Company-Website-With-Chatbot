## Remaining Tasks

### Image Conversion & Optimization
The following images need to be converted to WebP format for optimal performance:

1. **Sphoorthy Restaurant Logo**
   - Current: `/public/SPHOORTHY (1).jpg` (639 KiB)
   - Target: `/public/SPHOORTHY.webp` (~100 KiB max)
   - Recommended command: `npx sharp -i "public/SPHOORTHY (1).jpg" -o public/SPHOORTHY.webp --webp.quality 80 --resize 400`

2. **Ravrani Developers Logo**
   - Current: `/public/ravrani.png.jpg` (92 KiB)
   - Target: `/public/ravrani.webp` (~40 KiB max)
   - Recommended command: `npx sharp -i "public/ravrani.png.jpg" -o public/ravrani.webp --webp.quality 75 --resize 300`

3. **Other Client Logos**
   - Current: `/public/FIGURING OUT BY JAY (1).png` and `/public/futbol.png`
   - Targets: `/public/FIGURING OUT BY JAY.webp` and `/public/futbol.webp`
   - Recommended command: `npx sharp -i "[filename]" -o [output].webp --webp`

### Additional JavaScript Optimizations
- Consider code-splitting for large components
- Dynamically import non-critical components
- Implement lazy loading for below-the-fold components

## Verification

Once the remaining tasks are completed, verify performance improvements with Lighthouse:

1. Run Lighthouse audit in Chrome DevTools
2. Target metrics:
   - LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) < 2.5s
   - FCP (First Contentful Paint) < 1.5s
   - CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) < 0.1
   - Accessibility score = 100
   - SEO score = 100

## Long-Term Recommendations

1. **Implement Build-Time Image Optimization**
   - Consider using Vite plugins for automatic WebP conversion
   - Generate multiple sizes for responsive images
   
2. **Server-Side Rendering**
   - Consider migrating to Next.js for improved SEO and performance
   
3. **CDN Integration**
   - Use a CDN for serving static assets for better global performance

4. **Implement Resource Hints**
   - Further optimize with DNS-prefetch and prerender hints
